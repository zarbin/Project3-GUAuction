## Team Members

## Project Description

   The intent is to do reporting and faciliate analysis of an NFT market place, in particular cards in the blockchain game God's Unchained. 
   Each player has a set of cards in this game that they own, on the Ethereum blockchain, and I'd like to create a decentralized aunction
   in solidity for a given set of cards a player owns.  

   In Summary:
   * Report and Analyze an NFT marketplace - Reports / Dashboard of a given NFT collection
   * Create a decentralized auction in Solidity with said NFTs
   * Use a new API from blockchain game God's Unchained 

## Data Sources (APIs, Datasets)
   * OpenZepplin - Aunction Contact
       * https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v2.5.0/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Full.sol
       * https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v2.5.0/contracts/ownership/Ownable.sol
   * God's Unchained API - https://github.com/immutable/gods-unchained-api
   * Token Trove API - https://tokentrove.com/docs
    
## Rough Breakdown of Tasks
   * Learn how to use new APIs
   * Create and test datasets
   * Summarize / Visualize a players set in a useful way
   * Do marketplace analysis based on Token Trove
   * Create Aunction contract in Solidity using OpenZeppling
   * Develop process for a player to list their cards for auction
   * Document project
   * Prepare presentation
   * Highlight ongoing development and Layer2 to work around current Ethereum limitations
